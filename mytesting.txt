This life is not our own, we are just passing by.
There is a time to be born and a time to die. We will all give account of the
life lived here on earth.

We have hope because we have christ as our lord and personal saviour. No harm
will ever befall us. We are afraid of what will destroy both the soul and body and not just the body.
